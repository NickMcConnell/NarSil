# File: list.txt

# This file is used to initialize a list of graphics modes

# === Understanding list.txt ===

# name: serial number : pref file name
# directory: directory name
# size: tile width : tile height : tileset file name
# pref: preference file name
# extra: alphblending : start row : end row of double high tiles

# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. The pref file name is the name used
# on load to load the right pref file set for this tile set.

# 'directory' is for the pathname to the directory storing this mode's files.

# 'size' is for image information - tile width and height are the dimensions,
# in pixels, of an individual tile in the set. filename is the name of the
# image file to load.

# 'pref' is for preference file name - the name of the preference file which
# allocates tiles to game items.

# 'extra' is for extra information - alpha is a flag if the tileset needs to use
# alpha blending. double high tiles are ones that have twice the tile height
# as a typical tile. start row is the first row that uses double high tiles.
# End row is the last row that uses double high tiles. start row and end row
# must be greater than 0, if double high tiles are used, and refer to the
# bottom half of the double row.
