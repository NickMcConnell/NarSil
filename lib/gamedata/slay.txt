# File: slay.txt

# This file encodes the slays that can appear on objects.

# The name can generally be edited without bad effects though slays for the
# same type of creature should all use the same name.  Changes to the
# code will require changes to the other data files (artefact.txt,
# object_base.txt, object_property.txt, and special.txt) that may have used
# the code.  Changes to the race-flag, dice, and smith-difficulty can affect
# balance.  The race flag has to match one in list-mon-race-flags.h

# Fields:
# code: code for slay to use in other data files (artefact.txt,
#     object_base.txt, object_property.txt, and special.txt)
# name: name of slain creatures for use in object descriptions; also used for
#     detection of slays that are redundant
# race-flag: monster race flag which this slay affects; has to be different
#     than NONE and match the first argument to one of the RF() macros in
#     list-mon-race-flags.h; can not be used with another race-flag directive
#     for the same slay
# dice: number of bonus dice given by the slay
# smith-difficulty: difficulty cost to smith an item with this slay
