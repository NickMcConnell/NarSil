# File: brand.txt

# This file encodes the brands that can appear on objects.

# desc can generally be edited without bad effects.  Brands for the same
# element should use the same name and that should match the name used for
# that element in projection.txt.  Changes to the code will require changes to
# the other data files (artefact.txt, object_base.txt, object_property.txt,
# and special.txt) that may have used the code.  Changes to dice, vuln-dice,
# resist-flag, and vuln-flag can affect balance.

# Fields:
# code: code for brand to use in other data files (artefact.txt,
#     object_base.txt, object_property.txt, and special.txt)
# name: name of element of the brand
# dice: number of bonus dice given by the brand
# vuln-dice: number of bonus dice given by the brand if the monster is
#     especially vulnerable
# desc: description used when a susceptible monster is hit
# resist-flag: monster race flag for resistance to the brand element; has
#     to match the first argument to one of the RF() macros in
#     list-mon-race-flags.h
# vuln-flag: monster race flag for special vulnerability to the brand element;
#     has to match the first argument to one of the RF() macros in
#     list-mon-race-flags.h
