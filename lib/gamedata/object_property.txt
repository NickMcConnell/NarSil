# File: object_property.txt

# name: the property name
# type: the type of object property.  Each property needs one, and it must 
#       appear before the code in this file 
# subtype: subtype of object property, currently only used by flags
# id-type: how a property is identified, currently only used by flags
# code: a code for the object property, which is used to associate it with its
#       index among the other properties of that type
# smith-cat: is the name for the category in smithing's Artifice menu that
#            will include the property; if smith-cat is omitted for a property
#            the property can not be added to a smithed artifact; the name
#            of the category must be stat, sustain, skill, melee, slay,
#            resist, curse, or misc
# smith-difficulty: sets the additional smithing difficulty, an integer, to
#                   include this property on a smithed item; if the property is
#                   a flag, resist, slay, or brand, the difficulty is simply
#                   added to the total difficulty for the item when the item
#                   has the property; if the property is a stat, skill, or
#                   mod, the additional difficulty from adjusting the
#                   stat/skill/mod by v is zero if v is less than or equal to
#                   zero or v * difficulty value + (1 +
#                   ((difficulty value - 1) / 5)) * v * (v - 1) when v is
#                   greater than zero; if smith-difficulty is omitted for
#                   a property, adding the property does not increase the
#                   difficulty of the smithed item; note that a smithed
#                   item could get a property from the base item, an
#                   enchantment (i.e. from special.txt), or from a property
#                   added for an artifact so the difficulty could be relevant
#                   even if smith-cat is not set
# smith-cost: sets the cost, in addition to the added difficulty for including
#             the property on a smithed item; if smith-cost is omitted for a
#             property, including the property on a smithed item incurs no
#             additional cost; takes two parameters; the first is the name
#             of the attribute that incurs the cost; that name must either
#             be the name of a statistic (STR, DEX, CON, or GRA) or EXP; the
#             latter indicates that the cost is extracted from the player's
#             unspent experience pool; the second parameter is the integer
#             value of the cost; for a flag, resist, slay, or brand, the cost
#             is used as is when the property is included; if the property is
#             a stat, skill, or mod the cost for adjusting the stat/skill/mod
#             by v is v times the cost
# smith-exclude-base: sets whether the additional difficulty or cost for
#                     including a property on a smithed non-jewelry item will
#                     include whether or not the base item has the property;
#                     the costs and difficulty of smithed jewelry always
#                     includes the properties of the base item; if a
#                     property has smith-exclude-base:yes, the difficulty and
#                     cost will not be increased by the presence of the
#                     property on the base item (for a stat, skill, or mod,
#                     additional levels beyond what is present on the base
#                     item can affect the difficulty and cost); if a property
#                     has smith-exclude-base:no or does not specify
#                     smith-exclude-base, the presence of the property
#                     on the base item will be included in the difficulty and
#                     cost
# adjective: adjective describing the property as a player attribute, currently
#            only used by stats
# neg-adjective: adjective describing the opposite of the property as a player
#                attribute, currently only used by stats
# msg: message printed on noticing a property, currently used for flags which
#      are identified after time or on an effect
# desc: an extra piece of descriptive text used in object information
