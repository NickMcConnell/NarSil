# === Understanding history.txt ===
#
# Pieces of player backstory are chosen from "charts", which are lists of
# phrases or sentences with similar general meaning.

# 'chart' lines give the number of the current chart, the number of the chart
# that will be used next (or 0 if the last chart), a cutoff for choosing
# the current line, and a 'house' field (only used for the Noldor).  If the
# first field in two chart lines is the same, the second usually should be as
# well, to maintain consistent choices and end up with something readable.

# 'phrase' lines are the actual chart entries which make up the history.

# Background information (see below)
#
# Chart progression by race:
#
#  Noldor         -->  1 -->  2 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52
#  Sindar         -->  4 -->  5 --> 54 --> 55 --> 56
#  Edain          --> 21 --> 22 --> 23 --> 25 --> 26 --> 27 --> 28
#  Naugrim        --> 16 --> 17 --> 18 --> 57 --> 58 --> 59 --> 60 --> 61
