# File: player_timed.txt

# Used in conjunction with list-player-timed.h
# Timed player properties

# Descriptions, messages and message types can be edited without bad effects.
# Changing fail may have unpredictable results.
# Changing the name or adding whole new entries will severely disrupt the game.
# It should only be done when list-player-timed.h (and other code) is also being
# changed, and the game recompiled.
# Changing a resist line will have to match to one of the hard-coded elements
# from list-elements.h; currently, those resist lines are used to generate
# messages when the player has both a temporary and permanent resist.

# Fields:
# name - the effect name; the name must match the first argument to one of the
#        TMD() macros in list-player-timed.h
# desc - the effect description
# este - 1 if recovery from the effect is affected by Song of Este
# grade - specify a grade for this effect; most effects only have two grades:
#         off (implicit for all effects, maximum of 0, no transition messages)
#         and on (the grade specified for the effect in this file); some
#         effects do not use grade directives and instead use change-grade,
#         change-inc, and change-dec
#         param one: color used on the status line for this effect when in this
#             grade; may be a one letter color code or the full color name
#             (case insensitive)
#         param two: is the maximum for this grade; to work properly must be
#             greater than zero, less than 32768, and greater than the maximum
#             for any previous grades specified for this effect
#         param three: is the name of the grade and will be shown in the status
#             line; use a one character long name for the grade to suppress
#             showing the timed effect in the status line when in that grade
#         param four: is the message to display when the effect enters this
#             grade from a lower grade; no message will be displayed if the
#             message is one character long
#         param five (optional): is the message to display when the effect
#             enters this grade from a higher grade; no message will be
#             displayed if this parameter is omitted
# change-grade - specify a grade for this effect; only relevant if the effect
#                has no grade directives; may be used more than once for the
#                same effect
#                param one: color used on the status line for this effect
#                    when in this grade; may be a one letter color code or
#                    the full color name (case insensitive)
#                param two: is the maximum for this grade; to work properly
#                    must be greater than zero, less than 32768, and greater
#                    than the maximum for any previous grades specified for
#                    this effect; the maximum for the last grade specified
#                    for an effect is the upper bound for the value of that
#                    effect
#                param three: if greater than zero, is the number of digits
#                    to use when formatting the effect's value for display
#                    on the status line when in this grade; if less than or
#                    equal to zero, the effect's value is not shown on the
#                    status line
#                param four: is the name of the grade and will be shown on
#                    the status line; use a one character long name for the
#                    grade to suppress showning the timed effect in the status
#                    line when in that grade
# change-inc - specify a threshold and messages to display for increases to
#              the effect that are less than that threshold; only used when
#              the effect does not have any grade directives and has one or
#              more change-grade directives; may be used more than once for
#              the same effect; the last change-inc directive for an effect
#              is the one that will be used for any change that exceeds the
#              the thresholds specified in all the change-inc directives for
#              that effect
#              param one: is the threshold; to work as expected, the
#                  threshold must be greater than the threshold in any
#                  previous change-inc directives for this effect
#              param two: is the message to display if the effect was
#                  inactive prior to the change or the effect was active prior
#                  to the change and no third parameter was for this threshold;
#                  the message must not include a colon
#              param three (optional): is the message to display if the
#                  effect was active prior to the change
# change-dec - specify a divisor and message to display for decreases to
#              the effect whose absolute value is greater than the current
#              value of the effect divided by the divisor; only used when
#              the effect does not have any grade directives and has one
#              or more change-grade directives
# on-end - the message on ending the effect
# on-increase - the message on the effect increasing; only used if the effect
#               has one or more grade directives
# on-decrease - the message on the effect decreasing; only used if the effect
#               has one or more grade directives
# msgt - the message type to use for the change of grade, on-increase,
#        on-decrease, change-inc, and change-dec messages for this effect;
#        the type must either match (case-insensitive) the first argument
#        to one of the MSG() macros in list-message.h or be an unsigned integer
#        less than MSG_MAX which is the index of the message type to use
#        within list-message.h; on-end messages alwys use the RECOVER
#        message type if the effect has one or more grade directives; for
#        effects which do not have grade directives and use change-grade,
#        on-end messages will use the message type set by msgt; for the
#        textui user interface, the message type affects the message color
#        (configured globally by lib/customize/message.prf; also configurable
#        by preferences in the user's files) and the sound played when the
#        message is displayed (configured globally by lib/customize/sound.prf;
#        also configurable by preferences in the user's files)
# fail - determines what makes the effect fail (after a skill check); the
#        parameter is the name of the object flag that will cause the effect
#        to fail; the flag must match the first argument to one of the OF()
#        macros in the list-object-flags.h
# save - whether the player gets a save against the effect; the one parameter
#        is an integer which, if nonzero, means the player gets a save
# resist - (optional) when this timed property is active, the recipient gains
#          a temporary resistance to the named element
