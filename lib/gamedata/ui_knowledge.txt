# 'monster-category' introduces a set of directives to define a category of
# monsters in the monster knowledge menu.  It takes one parameter:  the name
# that will be shown in the menu for the category.  One name,
# "***Unclassified***" is reserved for internal use to catch any types of
# monsters that do not fall into any of the categories specified in this file.
# In the menu, the categories will appear in the same order that they are
# defined in this file.

# 'mcat-include-base' adds a monster base to be included in the most recent
# category specified by a 'monster-category' directive.  It takes one
# parameter:  the name of the monster base from monster_base.txt.  If that
# base does not exist or there is no prior 'monster-category' directive,
# that will trigger a parser error.  This directive may be used more than
# once for the same category.  If a category includes multiple monster bases,
# the knowledge menu will display those from a base specified earlier in this
# file before those from a base that appear later in this file.  Within the
# same monster base, the knowledge menu will sort the monster types by level
# and then by name.

# 'mcat-include-flag' adds one or more monster flags to be included in the most
# recent category specified by a 'monster-category' directive.  It takes
# one parameter:  a list of zero or more monster flags, separated by spaces
# or '|'.  Each flag must match one of the first arguments (except 'NONE') to
# a RF() macro in list-mon-race-flags.h.  All types of monsters that have a
# flag specified by 'mcat-include-flag' will be included in the category.
# This directive may be used more than once for the same category.  Monster
# types which only appear in a category because they possess a flag will
# appear, when displayed in the monster knowledge menu, after those that are
# included  because of a monster base and will be sorted by level and then
# by name.

# 'mcat-include-glyph' adds a glyph to be included in the most recent category
# specified by a 'monster-category' directive.  It takes one parameter:  the
# glyph to include.  All types of monsters whose default display glyph matches
# that glyph will be included in the category.  Monster types which only appear
# in a category because they match a glyph will appear, when displayed in the
# monster knowledge menu, after those that are included because of a monster
# base or flag.  If a category includes multiple glyphs, the knowledge menu
# will display the monster types included by a glyph specified earlier in this
# file before those included by a glyph specified later in this file.  For
# the same glyph, the monster types will be sorted by level and then by name.
