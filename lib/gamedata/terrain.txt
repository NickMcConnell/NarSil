# File: terrain.txt
#
# This file is used to create the "terrain feature" information for Sil.
#
# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
#
# Note that, unlike other edit files, modifying this file casually is likely
# to be a BAD IDEA (unless you intend to make actual programming changes)
# for two reasons:

#   1. Terrain features do not appear unless there is specific code in the
#   level generation algorithms to include them, so adding new terrain
#   features to this file will by itself have no effect.

#   2. Changing the properties (especially flags but also mimicry and extra
#   info) can significantly change game behavior, and any changes will likely
#   mess up a game which was started before the changes took place and is
#   reloaded when the changes are in effect.

# You may more freely alter the graphics, names, messages, and descriptions.
# Note that terrain feature zero contains the "darkness" picture.

# === Understanding terrain.txt ===
#
# code : code name from list-terrain.h
# name : terrain printable name
# graphics : symbol : color
# mimic : code name for the feature to mimic
# priority : display priority on mini-map
# flags : terrain flags
# info : supply additional information when diggable, a forge, or pit
# dig-msg : message for successfully digging
# fail-msg : message for not having an appropriate digger
# str-msg : message for when the player is not strong enough to dig
# walk-msg : warning message - waliking
# run-msg : warning message - running
# hurt-msg : damage message
# die-msg : death message
# confused-msg : message for confused monster move into non-passable terrain
# look-prefix : used before the name in the result from looking
# look-in-preposition : preprosition when looking at one's own position

# 'code' indicates the start of an entry.  The value used for the code
# must match the argument to one of the FEAT() macros in list-terrain.h.
#
# 'name' specifies the printable name for the terrain.  As this is displayed
# in the status bar and various menus, a short name is preferable.
#
# 'graphics' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 27 colors:
#
# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Umber
# W - Light Gray   P - Light Purple   y - Yellow        R - Light Red
# G - Light Green  B - Light Blue     U - Light Umber   p - Purple
# v - Violet       t - Teal           m - Mud           Y - Light Yellow
# i - Magenta-Pink T - Light Teal     V - Light Violet  I - Light Pink
# M - Mustard      z - Blue Slate     Z - Deep Light Blue
#
# 'mimic' is the code name (one of the arguments to the FEAT() macros in
# list-terrain.h) of a feature to mimic; some features look like another
# feature until they are discovered by the player.
#
# 'priority' is for display priority on the minimap, where only a selection
# of grids are chosen.  This enables the minimap to display the information
# most likely to be useful to the player.
#
# 'flags' is for terrain flags.
#
# 'info' is for other terrain information.  The first value is the bonus to
# give to forging when on the terrain.  The second value is the difficulty
# to dig out the terrain.  The third value is the difficulty for the player
# to get out of the terrain (i.e. to exit a pit).  When an entry does not
# have a 'info' line, all those values default to be zero.
#
# 'dig-msg' sets the message displayed when the terrain is dug out.  It is
# only relevant for diggable terrain (no PERMANENT flag and meets the
# criteria set by square_is_diggable() in cave-square.c).
#
# 'fail-msg' sets the message displayed when the player has a digger but
# it is not good enough to dig out the terrain.  It is only relevant for
# diggable terrain (see 'dig-msg' above).
#
# 'str-msg' sets the message displayed when the player has a digger that
# is good enough to dig out the terrain but the player is not strong enough
# to do the digging.  It is only relevant for diggable terrain (see 'dig-msg'
# above.
#
# 'walk-msg', 'run-msg', 'hurt-msg', 'die-msg', and 'confused-msg' are parsed
# but changes to the code would be needed to have them displayed to the
# player when appropriate.
#
# 'look-prefix' is printed before the name in the result of looking at the
# terrain.  If not set, the default is to use 'an' if the name starts with
# a vowel or 'a' if the name does not start with a vowel.
#
# 'look-in-preposition' is the preposition that will be used when printing
# the result for an observer looking at the observer's grid:  'You are
# <preposition> <prefix> <name>'.  If not set, the default is to use 'on'.
#
# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are neeeded
# to describe the terrain. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.
