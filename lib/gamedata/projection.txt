# projection.txt

# Descriptions, colors, message types, and obvious can be edited without
# bad effects.
# Changing the codes or their ordering has to be done with care and in
# conjunction with recompiling the game.  The projections of type element
# have to appear first in the same order and with the same codes as the
# listing of elements in list-elements.h.  The projections of other types
# have to appear after those of type element and in the same order as they
# are listed in list-projections.h.

# === Understanding projection.txt ===

# Format:
# code: code
# name: name
# type: element / environs / monster
# desc: description
# player-desc: player description
# blind-desc: blind description

# obvious: 0/1
# wake: 0/1
# color: color

# 'code' is the computer code for this projection used by the game.  For
# projections of type element, the code must match the argument to one of the
# ELEM() macros in list-elements.h, and those projections must appear first
# and in the order they are listed in list-elements.h.  For projections of
# other types, the code must match the argument to one of the PROJ()
# macros in list-projections.h, and those projections must appear in the
# order they are listed in list-projections.h.

# 'name' is the human readable name for this projection.

# 'type' can be 'element' for an elemental attack type, 'environs' for
# something that affects terrain or dungeon features, or 'monster' for
# direct effects on monsters.

# 'desc' is the descriptive name for the projection, usually used in object
# descriptions.

# 'player-desc' is similar to desc and is used primarily when describing
# beam, bolt, breath, spot, or sphere effects.

# 'blind-desc' is how the projection is described to the player when they
# cannot see the monster using it.

# 'msgt' is the message type code used by the message system.  The type must
# either match (case-insensitve) the first argument to one of the MSG() macros
# in list-message.h or be an unsigned integer less than MSG_MAX which is the
# index of the message type to use within list-message.h.  For the textui
# user interface, the message type affects the message color (configured
# globally by lib/customize/message.prf; also configurable by preferences
# in the user's files) and the sound played when the message is displayed
# (configured globally by lib/customize/sound.prf; also configurable by
# preferences in the user's files).

# 'damaging' indicates whether the projection can damage the player.  Use 1
# if it can; any other non-negative integer value (best to use 0) indicates
# that it cannot.

# 'evade' indicates whether the player can evade and get a protection roll
# against the projection's damage.  Use 1 if the player can evade and get
# a protection roll; any other non-negative integer value (best to use 0)
# indicates that the player can not mitigate the damage from the projection.
# The setting for 'evade' is only relevant if the projection sets 'damaging'
# to 1.
#
# 'obvious' indicates whether the nature of the projection effect is obvious
# to the player.  Use 1 if it is; any other non-negative integer value (best
# to use 0) indicates that it is not obvious.

# 'wake' indicates whether the projection will automatically wake affected
# monsters.  Use 1 if it will wake; any other non-negative integer value (best
# to use 0) indicates that the projection is not forced to wake an affected
# monster.

# 'color' is the colour of the projection.  You may use the one letter code
# for the color or the full color name (case insensitive).
