Command Descriptions
====================

The following command descriptions are listed as the command name plus the
default key to use it. For those who prefer the "Angband-like"
keyset, the name and key of the Angband-like command is also shown if it is
different. Then comes a brief description of the command, including
information about alternative methods of specifying the command in each
keyset, when needed.

Some commands use the "repeat count" to automatically repeat the command
several times, while others use the "repeat count" to specify a "quantity"
for the command, and still others use it as an "argument" of some kind.

The following command is very useful for beginners,

Command lists ('Enter')
  This brings up a little window in the middle of the screen, in which you
  can select what command you would like to use by browsing.  If you wish
  to begin playing immediately, you can use this option to navigate the 
  commands and refer to this guide when you need more details about 
  specific commands.

Inventory Commands
==================

Inventory list (``i``)
  Displays a list of objects being carried but not equipped. You can carry
  up to 23 different items, not counting those in your equipment. Often,
  many identical objects can be "stacked" into a "pile" which will count as
  a single item.  Each object has a weight, and if you carry more
  objects than your strength permits, you will begin to slow down. The
  amount of weight you can still carry without being overencumbered, or the
  amount of extra weight you are currently carrying is displayed at the top
  of the screen.
 
Equipment list (``e``)
  Use this command to display a list of the objects currently being used by
  your character. The standard body (which all races currently have) has
  12 slots for equipment. Every equipment slot corresponds to a different
  location on the body, and each of which may contain only one object at
  a time, and each of which may only contain objects of the proper "type".
  For the standard body these are WEAPON (weapon), BOW (missile launcher),
  RING (ring) (two of these), AMULET (amulet), LIGHT (light source),
  BODY_ARMOR (armor), CLOAK (cloak), SHIELD (shield), HAT (helmet),
  GLOVES (gloves), BOOTS (boots). You must be wielding/wearing certain
  objects to take advantage of their special powers.

Drop an item (``d``)
  This drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the dungeon
  floor. If the floor spot you are standing on already has an object in it,
  NarSil will attempt to drop the item onto an adjacent space.  Doors and
  traps are considered objects for the purpose of determining if the space 
  is occupied. This command may take a quantity, and takes some energy.

Destroy an item (``k``)
  This destroys an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor. If the
  selected pile contains multiple objects, you may specify a quantity. Once
  destroyed, items are gone forever.

Ignore an item (``G``)
  This ignores an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor. If the
  selected pile contains multiple objects, you may specify a quantity. When
  ignored, the game will sometimes prompt you whether to ignore only this
  item or all others like it.  If the second option is chosen, all similar
  items on the floor and in your inventory will be ignored.  To view all
  items regardless of whether they are ignored, you can use ``K`` to
  toggle the ignore setting on and off.

Wear/Wield equipment (``w``)
  To wear or wield an object in your inventory, use this command. Since
  only one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield an
  item into a slot which is already occupied, the old item will be first be
  taken off, and may in fact be dropped if there is no room for it in your
  inventory. Wielding ammunition will add it to an empty slot in your
  quiver and prompt you to replace a type of ammunition if your quiver is
  already full. This command takes some energy.

Remove equipment (``r``) or Take off equipment (``t``)
  Use this command to take off a piece of equipment and return it to your
  inventory. Occasionally, you will run into a cursed item which cannot be
  removed. These items normally penalize you in some way and cannot be
  taken off until the curse is removed. If there is no room in your
  inventory for the item, your pack will overflow and you will drop the
  item after taking it off. You may also remove ammunition from your quiver
  with this command. This command takes some energy.

Movement Commands
=================

Moving (arrow keys, number keys) or (arrow keys, number keys, 'yuhjklbn')
  This causes you to move one step in a given direction. If the square you
  wish to move into is occupied by a monster, you will attack it. If the
  square is occupied by a door or a trap you may attempt to open or disarm
  it if the appropriate option is set. Preceding this command with CTRL
  will cause you to attack in the appropriate direction, but will not move
  your character if no monster is there. These commands take some energy.

Walk (``_``)
  The walk command lets you willingly walk into a trap or a closed door,
  without trying to open or disarm it. This command may take a count,
  requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Run (``.``)
  This command will move in the given direction, following any bends in the
  corridor, until you either have to make a "choice" between two directions
  or you are disturbed. You can configure what will disturb you by setting
  the disturbance options. You may also use shift plus the "hjkl"
  direction keys (hjkl-movement), or shift plus the "original" direction
  keys on the keypad (both keysets, some machines) to run in a direction.
  This command may take an argument, requires a direction, and takes some
  energy.

Go up staircase (``<``)
  Climbs up an up staircase you are standing on. There is always at least
  one staircase going up on every level. Going up a staircase will take you
  to a new dungeon level. Note that whenever you leave a
  level, you will never find it again. This means that for
  all intents and purposes, any objects on that level are destroyed. This
  command takes some energy.

Go down staircase (``>``)
  Descends a down staircase you are standing on. There are always at least
  one staircase going down on each level, except for the bottom level which
  is Morgoth's lair. Going down a staircase will take you to a new dungeon
  level. See "Go Up Staircase" for more info. This command takes some energy.

Exchange places (``X``)
  This command is only available if you have the "Exchange Places" ability.
  It allows you to exchange places with an adjacent monster.

Resting Commands
================

Stay still (with pickup) (``z``) or Stay still (with pickup) (``s``)
  Stays in the same square for one move. If you normally pick up objects
  you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on. You may
  also use the ``5`` key (both keysets). This command may take a count, and
  takes some energy.

Get objects (``g``)
  Pick up objects and gold on the floor beneath you. Picking up gold takes
  no time, and objects take 1/10th of a normal turn each (maximum time cost
  is a full turn). You may pick up objects until the floor is empty or your
  backpack is full.

Rest (``Z``) or Rest (``R``)
  Resting can be told to automatically stop after a certain amount of time,
  or when various conditions are met. In any case, you always wake up when
  anything disturbing happens, or when you press any key. To rest, enter the
  Rest command, followed by the number of turns you want to rest, or ``*`` to
  rest until your hitpoints and voice are restored, or ``&`` to rest until
  you are fully "healed". This command may take an argument (used for the
  number of turns to rest), and takes some energy.

Alter Commands
==============

Tunnel (``T``)
  Tunnelling or mining is a very useful art. There are many kinds of rock,
  with varying hardness, including permanent rock (permanent), granite
  (very hard), quartz veins (hard), and rubble (very soft). Rubble sometimes
  covers an object but is easy to tunnel through.  Tunnelling requires a
  digging tool. This command may take a count, requires a direction, and
  takes some energy.

Open a door or chest (``o``)
  To open an object such as a door or chest, you must use this command. If
  the object is locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based on your
  disarming ability. If you open a trapped chest without disarming the
  traps first, the trap will be set off. Opening will automatically attempt
  to pick any door locks. You may need several tries to open a door or chest.
  This command may take a count, requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Close a door (``c``)
  Non-intelligent and some other creatures cannot open doors, so shutting
  doors can be quite valuable. Furthermore, monsters cannot see you behind
  closed doors, so closing doors may allow you to buy some time without
  being attacked. Broken doors cannot be closed.  This command may take a
  count, requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Bash a door (``b``) or Bash a door (``B``)
  If you cannot open a door, bashing it may open or break it, but this is a
  noisy process. This command may take a count, requires a direction, and
  takes some energy.

Disarm a trap or chest (``D``)
  You can attempt to disarm traps on the floor or on chests. If you fail,
  there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off. You can only
  disarm a trap after you have found it. This command may take a count,
  requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Alter (``/``) or Alter (``+``)
  This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select any of
  the "obvious" commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open, disarm),
  and, by using keymaps, to combine this keypress with directions. In
  general, this allows the use of the "control" key plus the appropriate
  "direction" key (including the hjkl direction keys in hjkl-movement
  mode) as a kind of generic "alter the terrain feature of an accessible
  grid" command. Note that the player's grid can be altered with ``5``.
  This command may take a count, requires a direction, and takes some energy.

Object Manipulation Commands
============================

Use an item (``u``) or Use an item (``U``)
  This command will use any item in the most appropriate manner. Individual
  item types have specific command which can be used to restrict selection to
  items of that type, but the general use command is usually easier. This
  command takes some energy.
 
Eat some food (``E``)
  You must eat regularly to prevent starvation. There is a hunger meter
  at the bottom of the screen, which says "Fed". If you go hungry long enough,
  you will become weak, then start fainting, and eventually, you may well die
  of starvation (accompanied by increasingly alarming messages on your hunger
  indicator). It is also possible to be "Full", which will make you move
  slowly. You may use this command to eat food in your
  inventory. Note that you can sometimes find food in the dungeon, but it
  is not always wise to eat strange food. This command takes some energy.

Fuel your lantern/torch (``^f``)
  If you are using a lantern and have flasks of oil in your pack, then you
  can "refuel" them with this command. Torches and Lanterns are limited
  in their maximal fuel. In general, two flasks will fully fuel a lantern.
  This command takes some energy.

Quaff a potion (``q``)
  Use this command to drink a potion. Potions affect the player in various
  ways, but the effects are not always immediately obvious. This command
  takes some energy.

Inscribe an object (``{``) 
  This command inscribes a string on an object. The inscription is
  displayed inside curly braces after the object description. The
  inscription is limited to the particular object (or pile) and is not
  automatically transferred to all similar objects. Under certain
  circumstances, Narsil will display "fake" inscriptions on certain
  objects ('tried', 'empty') when appropriate. These "fake" inscriptions
  remain all the time, even if the player chooses to add a "real" inscription
  on top of it later.

  An item labeled as '{empty}' was found to be out of charges, and an
  item labeled as '{tried}' is a "flavored" item which the character has
  used, but whose effects are unknown. Certain inscriptions have a meaning
  to the game, see '@#', '@x#', '!*', and '!x', in the section on
  inventory object selection.

Uninscribe an object (``}``)
  This command removes the inscription on an object. This command will have
  no effect on "fake" inscriptions added by the game itself.
  
Toggle ignore (``P``)
  This command will toggle ignore settings.  If on, all ignored items 
  will be hidden from view.  If off, all items will be shown regardless
  of their ignore setting.  See the customize section for more info.

Magical Object Commands and Singing
===================================

Use a staff (``a``) or Use a staff (``u``)
  This command will use a staff. A staff will normally either have an area
  effect or affect a specific object. Staves are magical devices, and there is
  a chance you will not be able to figure out how to use them. This command
  takes some energy.
 
Play an instrument (``p``)
  This command will blow a horn. Horns have a variety of effects, and take a
  direction (in some cases, up ``<`` or down ``>``). This command
  takes some energy.

Sing (``s``) or Sing (``a``)
  This command will begin a song of power, if you know any.  It is also used to
  finish singing. This command takes some energy.

Throwing and Missile Weapons
============================

Fire an item (``f``)
  This command will allow you to fire a missile from your primary quiver
  provided you have a bow equipped. Fired ammunition has a chance of breaking.
  This command takes some energy.

Fire an item (``F``)
  This command will allow you to fire a missile from your secondary quiver
  provided you have a bow equipped. Fired ammunition has a chance of breaking.
  This command takes some energy.

Fire default ammo at nearest (``m``)
  If you have a bow equipped and the arrows in your quiver, you can use this
  command to fire at the nearest visible enemy. This command will cancel itself
  if you lack a bow, ammunition or a visible target that is in range.
  The first arrow in the primary quiver is used. This command takes some energy.

Throw an item (``t``) or Throw an item (``v``)
  You may throw any object carried by your character. Depending on the
  weight, it may travel across the room or drop down beside you. Only one
  object from a pile will be thrown at a time. Note that throwing an object
  will often cause it to break, so be careful! Some
  weapons are especially designed for throwing.  Once the
  creature is hit, the object may or may not do any damage to it. 
  Note that potions may have effects on a monster on impact. 
  If you are wielding a bow, then you automatically use it to fire arrows
  with much higher range, accuracy, and damage, than you would get by just
  throwing them. Throw, like fire, requires a direction. Targeting
  mode (see the next command) can be invoked with ``*`` at the 
  'Direction?' prompt. This command takes some energy.

Targeting Mode (``*``)
  This will allow you to aim your ranged attacks at a specific monster or
  grid, so that you can point directly towards that monster or grid (even
  if this is not a "compass" direction) when you are asked for a direction.
  You can set a target using this command, or you can set a new target at
  the "Direction?" prompt when appropriate. At the targeting prompt, you
  have many options. First of all, targeting mode starts targeting nearby
  monsters which can be reached by fired or thrown objects.
  In this mode, you can press ``t`` (or ``5`` or ``.``) to select the
  current monster, space to advance to the next monster, ``-`` to back up to
  the previous monster, direction keys to advance to a monster more or less
  in that direction, ``r`` to "recall" the current monster, ``q`` to exit
  targeting mode, and ``p`` (or ``o``) to stop targeting monsters and
  enter the mode for targeting a location on the floor or in a wall. Note
  that if there are no nearby monsters, you will automatically enter this
  mode. Note that hitting ``o`` is just like ``p``, except that the
  location cursor starts on the last examined monster instead of on the
  player. In this mode, you use the "direction" keys to move around, and
  the ``q`` key to quit, and the ``t`` (or ``5`` or ``.``) key to target
  the cursor location. Note that targeting a location is slightly
  "dangerous", as the target is maintained even if you are far away. To
  cancel an old target, simply hit ``*`` and then 'ESCAPE' (or ``q``).
  Note that when you cast a spell or throw an object at the target
  location, the path chosen is the "optimal" path towards that location,
  which may or may not be the path you want. Sometimes, by clever choice of
  a location on the floor for your target, you may be able to convince a
  thrown or fired object to squeeze through a hole or corridor that is
  blocking direct access to a different grid.

Target closest monster (``'``)
  This will set the closest visible monster as your target.  It has the same
  effect as ``*`` followed by ENTER.

Forging
=======
Forge an item (``0``) or (``^d``)
  If you are standing on a forge with uses remaining, this will begin the
  process of smithing an item. If you are not on a forge, or on a forge which
  is exhausted, this command allows you to see what you could smith if you were
  at an appropriate forge. Forging an item takes multiple turns; you will
  be able to see before you start how many turn are required.

Looking Commands
================

Full screen map (``M``)
  This command will show a map of the entire dungeon, reduced by a factor
  of nine, on the screen. Only the major dungeon features will be visible
  because of the scale, so even some important objects may not show up on
  the map. This is particularly useful in locating where the stairs are
  relative to your current position, or for identifying unexplored areas of
  the dungeon.

Locate player on map (``L``)
  This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors of
  the current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point the map
  will be re-centered on the player if necessary. To scroll the map around,
  simply press any of the "direction" keys. The top line will display the
  sector location, and the offset from your current sector.

Look around (``l``)
  This command is used to look around at nearby monsters (to determine 
  their type and health) and objects (to determine their type). It is also 
  used to find out if a monster is currently inside a wall, and what is 
  under the player. When you are looking at something, you may hit space 
  for more details, or to advance to the next interesting monster or 
  object, or minus (``-``) to go back to the previous monster or object, 
  or a direction key to advance to the nearest interesting monster or 
  object (if any) in that general direction, or ``r`` to recall 
  information about the current monster race, or ``q`` or escape to stop 
  looking around. You always start out looking at "yourself". 

Examine an item (``x``) or Inspect an item (``I``)
  This command lets you inspect an item. This will tell you things about
  the special powers of the object, as well as attack information for
  weapons. It will also tell you what resistances or abilities you have
  noticed for the item and if you have not yet completely identified all
  properties.
        
List visible monsters (``[``)
  This command lists all monsters that are visible to you, telling you how
  many there are of each kind. It also tells you whether they are asleep,
  and where they are (relative to you).

List visible items (``]``)
  This command lists all items that are visible to you, telling you how of
  each there are and where they are on the level relative to your current
  location.

Message Commands
================

View previous messages ('^p')
  This command shows you all the recent messages. You can scroll through
  them, or exit with ESCAPE.

Take notes (``:``)
  This command allows you to take notes, which will then appear in your
  message list and your character history (prefixed with "Note:").

Game Status Commands
====================

Character Description (``@``) or Character Description (``C``)
  Brings up a full description of your character, including your skill
  levels, your current and potential stats, and various other information.
  From this screen, you can change your name, gain abilities, increase skills,
  view your character's history, or use the file character description
  command to save your character status to a file. This last command
  saves additional information, including your background, your inventory,
  and the contents of your house.

Display abilities (``TAB``)
  This command takes you directly to the ability screen (also accessible from
  the character description screen). From this screen you can view or gain
  abilities.

Check knowledge (``~``)
  This command allows you to ask about the knowledge possessed by your
  character. Currently, this includes being able to list all known
  "artefacts", "uniques", and "objects". The "uniques" are special "unique"
  monsters which can only be killed once per game. Certain "objects" come in
  "flavors", and you must determine the effect of each "flavor" once for each
  such type of object, and this command will allow you to display all "known"
  flavors. Inscribing items in this list will cause you to similarly inscribe
  all similar items you find from this point on.

Saving and Exiting Commands
===========================

Save and Quit ('Ctrl-x')
  To save your game so that you can return to it later, use this command.
  Save files will also be generated (hopefully) if the game crashes due to
  a system error. After you die, you can use your savefile to play again
  with the same options and such.

Save ('Ctrl-s')
  This command saves the game but doesn't exit NarSil. Use this frequently
  if you are paranoid about having your computer crash (or your power go
  out) while you are playing.

Quit (``Q``)
  Kills your character and exits NarSil. You will be prompted to make sure
  you really want to do this, and then asked to verify that choice. Note
  that dead characters are dead forever.

User Pref File Commands
=======================

Interact with options (``O``) or Interact with options (``=``)
  Allow you to interact with options. Note that using the "cheat" options
  may mark your savefile as unsuitable for the high score list. The
  "window" options allow you to specify what should be drawn in any of the
  special sub-windows (not available on all platforms). See the help files
  'customize.txt' and 'options.txt' for more info. You can also interact
  with keymaps under this menu.

Interact with keymaps - option submenu
  Allow you to interact with keymaps. You may load or save keymaps from
  user pref files, or define keymaps. You must define a "current action",
  shown at the bottom of the screen, before you attempt to use any of the
  "create macro" commands, which use that "current action" as their action.
 
Interact with visuals - option submenu
  Allow you to interact with visuals. You may load or save visuals from
  user pref files, or modify the attr/char mappings for the monsters,
  objects, and terrain features. You must use the "redraw" command ('^r')
  to redraw the map after changing attr/char mappings. NOTE: It is
  generally easier to modify visuals via the "knowledge" menus.

Interact with colors - option submenu
  Allow the user to interact with colors. This command only works on some
  systems. NOTE: It is commonly used to brighten the 'Light Dark' color
  (eg. Cave Spiders) on displays with bad alpha settings.

Help Commands
=============

Help (``?``)
  Brings up the NarSil on-line help system. Note that the help files are
  just brief descriptions of available comands and symbols; this manual is
  the most comprehensive source of information.

Identify Symbol (``|``) or Identify Symbol (``/``)
  Use this command to find out what a character stands for. For instance,
  by entering '.', you can find out that the ``.`` symbol stands for a
  floor spot. When used with a symbol that represents creatures, the this
  command will tell you only what class of creature the symbol stands for,
  not give you specific information about a creature you can see. To get
  that, use the Look command.

  There are three special symbols you can use with the Identify Symbol
  command to access specific parts of your monster memory. Typing
  'Ctrl-a' when asked for a symbol will recall details about all
  monsters, typing 'Ctrl-u' will recall details about all unique
  monsters, and typing 'Ctrl-n' will recall details about all non-unique
  monsters.

  If the character stands for a creature, you are asked if you want to
  recall details. If you answer yes, information about the creatures you
  have encountered with that symbol is shown in the Recall window if
  available, or on the screen if not. You can also answer ``k`` to see the
  list sorted by number of kills, or ``p`` to see the list sorted by 
  dungeon level the monster is normally found on. Pressing 'ESCAPE' at 
  any point will exit this command.

Game Version (``V``)
  This command will tell you what version of NarSil you are using. For
  more information, see the 'version.txt' help file.

Extra Commands
==============

Toggle Choice Window ('^e')
  Toggles the display in any sub-windows (if available) which are
  displaying your inventory or equipment.

Redraw Screen ('^r')
  This command adapts to various changes in global options, and redraws all
  of the windows. It is normally only necessary in abnormal situations,
  such as after changing the visual attr/char mappings, or enabling
  "graphics" mode.

Save screen dump (|``)``|)
  This command dumps a "snap-shot" of the current screen to a file,
  including encoded color information. The command has two variants:

  - html, suitable for viewing in a web browser.
  - forum embedded html for vBulletin, suitable for pasting in
    web forums like http://angband.oook.cz/forums.
	
Special Keys
============
 
Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special keys are
control keys, and often, you can disable their special effects.

If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-c will interrupt
NarSil. The second and third interrupt will induce a warning bell, and the
fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message, since the
fifth will quit the game, after killing your character. Also, 'Ctrl-z'
will suspend the game, and return you to the original command shell, until
you resume the game with the 'fg' command. There is now a compilation
option to force the game to prevent the "double 'ctrl-z' escape death
trick". The 'Ctrl-\\' and 'Ctrl-d' and 'Ctrl-s' keys should not be
intercepted.

It is often possible to specify "control-keys" without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret (``^``) followed by the key. This is
useful for specifying control-key commands which might be caught by the
operating system as explained above.

Pressing backslash (``\``) before a command will bypass all keymaps, and
the next keypress will be interpreted as an "underlying command" key,
unless it is a caret (``^``), in which case the keypress after that will be
turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the underlying
angband keyset. For example, the sequence ``\`` + ``.`` + ``6`` will always
mean "run east", even if the ``.`` key has been mapped to a different
underlying command.

The ``R`` (``0`` in the Angband-like keyset), ``^`` and ``\`` keys all have
special meaning when entered at the command prompt, and there is no "useful"
way to specify any of them as an "underlying command", which is okay, since
they would have no effect.

For many input requests or queries, the special character ESCAPE will abort
the command. The '[y/n]' prompts may be answered with ``y`` or ``n``, or
'ESCAPE'. The '-more-' message prompts may be cleared (after reading
the displayed message) by pressing 'ESCAPE', 'SPACE', 'RETURN',
'LINEFEED', or by any keypress, if the "quick_messages" option is turned
on.
 
Command Counts
==============

Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding them
with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count expires, until
you type any character, or until something significant happens, such as
being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn't work to attack another
creature. While the command is being repeated, the number of times left to
be repeated will flash by on the line at the bottom of the screen.

To give a count to a command, type ``R`` (``0`` in the Angband-like keyset),
the repeat count, and then the command. If you want to give a movement command
and you are not using hjkl-movement (so the movement commands are digits),
press space after the count and you will be prompted for the command.

Counted commands are very useful for time consuming commands, as they
automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may also
terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing any
character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a 'SPACE' 
or 'ESCAPE' which are always ignored as commands in case you type the
command just after the count expires.
